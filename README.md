Process flow
- window opens:
    - day and date at the top
    - input box underneath and to the right of day and date. it will take positive integer hours, minutes and seconds as input
    - ledger underneath and to the left of day and date. Title "ledger". Two columns.
    - "start block" and "stark break" buttons underneath the input box
    - "End session" button at the bottom right underneath the ledger.
    - entry into ledger "Session start | currenttime(24 hour format, system time)"
- when user enters time into input box and clicks "start block":
    - ledger appended with "Block n | currenttime", where n is the block count for that session, starting at 1.
    - Timer display in input box starts counting down in 1second increments.
    - when timer display reaches zero:
        - display message saying "block complete"
        - play alert sound
- when user enters time into input box and clicks "start break":
    - ledger appended with "Break n | currenttime", where n is the break count for that session, starting at 1.
    - Timer display in input box starts counting down in 1second increments.
    - when timer display reaches zero:
        - display message saying "break complete"
        - play alert sound
- When the user presses the End session button:
    -   "Session end | currenttime" appended to the ledger
    - if possible, a basic log file of this could be updated/generated, that would be cool. each update in the log file would need to have the date appended it in a 3rd column on a row by row basis. this would allow for effective time use analysis. The long term could be that this tool creates a log of your work. making this an internet tool, with functionality such as giving a label for your block of work (eg. "python", "deeperseeker5000" etc) and allowing others to log their work as well would be neat. beyond the current scope of this current version though.
